Release Notes 
//////////////////////////////V0.8//////////////////////////////
Resolved Bugs
•	Fixed issue where images with URL's beginning with // caused 
	a "...URI prefix is not recognized." exception.
•	Fixed issue where Int type was being returned caused a 
	"xxxxxxxxxxxxxx is not a valid value for Int32." exception.
•	Added urlLog.txt to root directory for debug purposes when

	after my code tried to format them ^.^ So that will really
